# Theoretical-FFR
Matlab scripts to generate theoretical frequency-following resonses (FFRs). FFRFineStructureModel.m is the main script that loads in models parameters and then generates theorectical FFRS. See Tichko &amp; Skoe (2017), Hearing Research, for model details. Also includes model parameters from Purcell et al. (2004), JASA, to simulate evelope-following responses.
